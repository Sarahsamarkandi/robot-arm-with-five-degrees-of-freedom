# Robot-arm-with-five-degrees-of-freedom
In the Smart Methods mechanics track, I used Tinkercad to design a robot arm with five degrees of freedom. This project involved creating a detailed 3D model of the robot arm, ensuring that each joint allowed for precise movements across different axes. Utilizing Tinkercad's tools, I was able to visualize and simulate the arm's range of motion, providing a practical understanding of mechanical design and kinematics. This task enhanced my skills in Tinkercad and deepened my knowledge of robotics.
